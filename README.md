# Mastermind-game
A code-breaking game where players must guess a secret combination made by the computer using logic and clues. This was made using Python.

- The computer(codemaker) will randomly generate the combination
of 4 fruits from a list of 8 possible fruits.

- The player(codebreaker) will have the chance to make a series of 10
guesses.

- After each guess the computer gives feedback for the number of
fruits that are of the correct colour and in the correct position, and
the number of fruits that are of the correct colour but not in the
correct position .

• Bulls will represent: correct colour and in the correct position.

• Cows will represent: correct colour but not in the correct position .
